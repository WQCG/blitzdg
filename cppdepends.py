usage: python cppdepends.py dir out [threshold]
dir is the path to the directory you wish to generate a dependency graph for.
out is the file that you wish to generate.
threshhold is a multiple of the average number of times a file is included.   If
   a file is included more than average # of includes * threshhold times, it is
 highlighted in red.  Defaults to 1.
Example usage: python cppdenends.py code/project/src graph.pdf 2
